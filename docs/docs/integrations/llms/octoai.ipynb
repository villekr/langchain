    ">[OctoML](https://docs.octoai.cloud/docs) is a service with efficient compute. It enables users to integrate their choice of AI models into applications. The `OctoAI` compute service helps you run, tune, and scale AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `OctoAI` [LLM endpoints](https://octoai.cloud/templates)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To run our example app, there are four simple steps to take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the MPT-7B demo template to your OctoAI account by visiting <https://octoai.cloud/templates/mpt-7b-demo> then clicking \"Clone Template.\" \n",
    "   1. If you want to use a different LLM model, you can also containerize the model and make a custom OctoAI endpoint yourself, by following [Build a Container from Python](doc:create-custom-endpoints-from-python-code) and [Create a Custom Endpoint from a Container](doc:create-custom-endpoints-from-a-container)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Paste your Endpoint URL in the code cell below\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get an API Token from [your OctoAI account page](https://octoai.cloud/settings).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Paste your API key in in the code cell below"
